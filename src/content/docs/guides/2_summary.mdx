## GitHub Issues and Milestones

In the ghqc workflow:
- An Issue is created for each project file selected for QC
    - Each Issue is associated with a QC checklist and an assigned QCer
- A set of Issues is organized into a Milestone
    - A Milestone may correspond to a deliverable or a phase of work

## Author: Assign files for QC

export const assignAppCode = `# library(ghqc)
ghqc_assign_app()`;
export const console = 'console';


<Steps>

1. The Author pushes final changes to the set of files for QC review

2. The Author runs the Assign shiny app to:
    - notify the QCer that files assigned to her are ready for review
    - publish each file's QC checklist to GitHub with the correct commit and branch for the QCer to checkout

    <Code code={assignAppCode} lang="R" title={console} />


</Steps>

### Example

Here is an example GitHub Milestone:
It has 3 Issues, each named for the relative path of its corresponding file.

<Aside>
To navigate to this page in the remote project repository, click the "Issues" tab, then click on the "Milestones" banner.
</Aside>

Within this set of Issues, here is scripts/DA/study1_da.qmd:

![issue_example](/ghqc-docs/issue_example.png)

### Demo 

<Code code={assignAppCode} lang="R" title={console} />

<video controls width = "700">
    <source src="/ghqc-docs/assign_example.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

## QCer: Review each assigned file

export const gitLogCode = `git log --oneline -1`;
export const terminal = 'terminal';

<Steps>

1. The QCer clones the repository.

2. The QCer runs the following git command to get the current local commit:

    <Code code={gitLogCode} lang="bash" title={terminal} />

    ![qc_feedback2](/ghqc-docs/qc_feedback2.png)

3. For each Issue assigned to her, the QCer ensures that her current local commit matches the `initial qc commit` from the Issue metadata section.

    ![qc_feedback1](/ghqc-docs/qc_feedback1.png)

4. If the commits don't match, she can checkout the commit manually.

    <Code code="git checkout 0916356" lang="bash" title={terminal} /> 
    
</Steps>


## QCer: Comment QC Feedback

### Example

QC feedback can be given directly by commenting in an Issue thread.

![qc_feedback3](/ghqc-docs/qc_feedback3.png)

The QCer can comment on one or more lines of code by copying a permalink from the file contents page in the metadata section.

![qc_feedback5](/ghqc-docs/qc_feedback5.png)

### Demo
<video controls width = "700">
    <source src="/ghqc-docs/qc_feedback4.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

<Aside>
Tip to copy multiple lines: after selecting the first line, hold shift when selecting the last line, then click the three dots to copy the permalink.
</Aside>


## Author: Resolve QC findings

export const resolveAppCode = `# library(ghqc)
ghqc_resolve_app()`;

<Steps>

1. The Author views commented feedback from the QCer and responds if follow-up is necessary.

2. The Author implements QC findings.

3. The Author commits and pushes changes to the remote repository.

4. The Author runs the Resolve app which creates an Issue comment intended to:

    - Notify the QCer about QC file changes
    - Inform the QCer on the current commit for QC
    - Display a visual to the QCer with specific file changes 

    <Code code={resolveAppCode} lang="R" title={console} />

    

</Steps>

### Example

![resolve1](/ghqc-docs/resolve1.png)

The `current commit` in the metadata section gives the commit with the most up-to-date version of the file.

The QCer can pull changes from the branch or checkout the given commit to re-review the file with the pushed changes.

### Demo
<video controls width = "700">
    <source src="/ghqc-docs/resolve1.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>


## QCer: Close Issues when QC is complete

When the state of the file is to the QCer's satisfaction, each item in the Issue's checklist should be checked, and the Issue can be closed by the QCer.

<video controls width = "700">
    <source src="/ghqc-docs/issue_closed.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

If the given Issue is the last open Issue in the Milestone (indicated by the full progress bar), the Milestone can be closed to mark its completion.

<video controls width = "700">
    <source src="/ghqc-docs/milestone_closed.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>


## Author: Generate QC Record

export const recordAppCode = `# library(ghqc)
ghqc_record_app()`;

<Code code={recordAppCode} lang="R" title={console} />

This function allows the user to generate a QC Record for one or more Milestones created with ghqc_assign_app.

The QC Record is a pdf with summary tables and Issue contents within each selected Milestone.

<video controls width = "700">
    <source src="/ghqc-docs/record1.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

### Output

The QC Record begins with a Milestone Summary table.

Each Milestone section contains an Issue Summary table with subsections for each ghqc Issue.
