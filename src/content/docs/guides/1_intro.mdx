## GitHub Issues and Milestones

**Issues** are used to track individual tasks, enhancements, or other work items within a GitHub repository.\
Issues typically contain a title, body, comments, and assignee(s).

**Milestones** group related Issues under a common goal or timeline, such as a project phase. 

*`ghqc` is an R package that co-opts Issues and Milestones for QC.*

The QC script Author begins the QC workflow by running the Assign app, which is a Shiny app that allows him to select a set of QC files in his project directory.\
For each QC file, the author selects a checklist template from his organization and optionally a QCer.

The app creates a GitHub Issue for each selected QC file and organizes them into a Milestone.\
Each Issue body also includes a metadata section with configuring information for the QCer and tooling.

## Example 

Here is an example GitHub Milestone created by the Assign app:
It has one ghqc Issue, named for the relative path of its corresponding file.

## QC review

The QCer is notified of QC assignment in GitHub or receives the Issue link and assigns herself.

To review, the QCer:
- Clones the repo/pulls the initial qc commit given by the metadata section
- Reviews the file 
- Checks off checklist items in the Issue body
- Posts review comments in the Issue thread for discourse with the Author
- Approves the Issue when QC is complete
