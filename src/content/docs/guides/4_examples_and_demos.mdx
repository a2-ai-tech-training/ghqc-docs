See below for examples of each step of the following workflow pattern.

![workflow_summary](/ghqc-docs/workflow_summary.png)


## Author creates Milestone

export const assignAppCode = `library(ghqc)
ghqc_assign_app()`;
export const console = 'console';


<Steps>

1. The Author pushes final changes to the set of files for QC review.

2. The Author runs the Assign shiny app to:
    - notify the QCer that files assigned to her are ready for review
    - publish each QC file's corresponding Issue to GitHub, each with a QC checklist and metadata for traceability

    <Code code={assignAppCode} lang="r" title={console} />

3. The Author edits each Issue to revise the QC checklist, insert information into placeholders, and provide necessary context for the QCer.
   ![edit_issue](/ghqc-docs/edit_issue.png)


</Steps>

### Example 

Here is an example GitHub Milestone created by the Assign app:
It has one ghqc Issue, named for the relative path of its corresponding file.

![assign_diagram](/ghqc-docs/milestone_example2.png)

Here is the Issue within this Milestone:

![assign_diagram](/ghqc-docs/issue_example2.png)

### Demo 

<Code code={assignAppCode} lang="r" title={console} />

<video controls width = "700">
    <source src="/ghqc-docs/assign_demo.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

## QCer configures repo and reviews

export const statusAppCode = `library(ghqc)
ghqc_status_app()`;


The QCer:
<Steps>

1. Assigns herself to the Issue if she's not already assigned

   ![qcer_assigned](/ghqc-docs/qcer_assigned.png)

2. Clones the repository if necessary

3. Confirms that her local repo is configured for QC with the Status app

    <Code code={statusAppCode} lang="r" title={console} />

    <video controls width = "700">
        <source src="/ghqc-docs/qcer_config.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
    </video>

    She may have to switch branches or pull to get the most the most recent version of the QC file. 

    She can confirm she's reviewing the correct QC file version in her local repo by verifying its Git Status is <span style="color: #27770a;">Up to date</span> in the Status app.

4. Reviews the QC file

5. Checks off items in the Issue body's QC Checklist
   ![check_off](/ghqc-docs/check_off.png)
    
</Steps>


## QCer gives feedback

QC review workflows vary between organizations. QCer protocol can range from:

- Providing feedback while leaving code unchanged
- Commenting in-line feedback within the code
- Directly revising code

### Providing feedback while leaving code unchanged

#### Example

QC feedback can be provided by commenting directly in a QC file's Issue thread.

<Aside title="Tip">
With `ghqc_status_app()` open, the QCer can navigate to the Issue thread quickly.

![qc_feedback2](/ghqc-docs/issue_thread_link.png)
</Aside>

![qc_feedback3](/ghqc-docs/qc_feedback_general.png)

The QCer can comment on one or more lines of code by copying a permalink from the file contents page in the metadata section.

![qc_feedback5](/ghqc-docs/qc_feedback_inline.png)

#### Demo
<video controls width = "700">
    <source src="/ghqc-docs/qc_feedback4.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

<Aside title="Tip">
To copy multiple lines: after selecting the first line, hold shift when selecting the last line, then click the three dots to copy the permalink.
</Aside>

### Commenting in-line feedback within the code
#### Example

export const newlineCode = `# QC: Change the value of this seed
seed <- 12345`;

export const noNewlineCode = `seed <- 12345 # QC: Change the value of this seed`;



<Steps>

1. The QCer pushes in-line code comments directly to the Author's branch.

2. (Optional) The QCer posts a QC Notification for the Author.

    ![qc_feedback6](/ghqc-docs/qc_feedback_code.png)

    <Aside>
    Make a **newline** for QC comments to avoid merge conflicts with the Author.

    Like this:
    <Code code={newlineCode} lang="r"/>
    Instead of this:
    <Code code={noNewlineCode} lang="r"/>

    </Aside>

 
</Steps>



#### Demo

<Code code={statusAppCode} lang="r" title={console} />

<video controls width = "700">
    <source src="/ghqc-docs/qc_feedback_demo.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

## Author responds

<Steps>

1. If the QCer left in-line code comments, the Author pulls.

2. The Author views QC feedback and follows up if necessary.

3. If file changes are necessary, the Author pushes them to the remote repo.

4. (Optional) The Author posts a QC Notification for the QCer.

</Steps>

### Example

![resolve1](/ghqc-docs/author_responds.png)

The `current commit` in the metadata section gives the commit with the most up-to-date version of the file.



### Demo

<Code code={statusAppCode} lang="r" title={console} />

<video controls width = "700">
    <source src="/ghqc-docs/author_responds.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>


## QCer approves

<Steps>

1. The QCer confirms that no further feedback or file changes are pending.

2. The QCer checks off each item in the QC checklist on the QC file's Github Issue.

3. The QCer ensures that no in-line code comments are lingering and that the file state is up-to-date with the most recent version from the Author.

4. The QCer approves with `ghqc_status_app()`

</Steps>

### Example

![approve1](/ghqc-docs/qcer_approves.png)


### Demo
<Code code={statusAppCode} lang="r" title={console} />

<video controls width = "700">
    <source src="/ghqc-docs/qcer_approves.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>


## Author generates QC Record

The QC Record is a pdf with the QC history scraped from GitHub for each Issue created with `ghqc_assign_app()`. 

It also provides summary tables for an overview of the QC process.

<Steps>

1. The Author closes all relevant Milestones to mark them as completed.

    ![close](/ghqc-docs/close_milestone.png)

2. The Author runs `ghqc_status_app()` to double-check the status of each Issue in the set of Milestones to ensure completion.

    ![approved](/ghqc-docs/approved_file.png)
    The author verifies that QC is complete when the QC Status is <span style="color: #27770a;">Approved</span> and the Git Status is <span style="color: #27770a;">Up to date</span>.
    

3. The Author generates the QC record with `ghqc_record_app()` (demo below).

4. The Author merges and deletes his branch.
    <video controls width = "700">
        <source src="/ghqc-docs/merge_and_delete.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
    </video>

</Steps>


### Example

The QC Record begins with a Milestone Summary table.

Each Milestone section contains an Issue Summary table with subsections for each Issue.
