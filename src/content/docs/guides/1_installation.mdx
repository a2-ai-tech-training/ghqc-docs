The ghqc ecosystem is split into 4 components to give the user control over the QC process
while ensuring additional project package dependencies are minimal.

    `ghqc` is a low dependency burden package designed to be installed alongside any project packages.

## Install ghqc

`ghqc` can be installed with `pak`:

<Code code={`
# install.packages("pak")
pak::pkg_install("a2-ai/ghqc")
`} lang="r" title="console" />

## Setup

After installation, users can run `ghqc::setup_ghqc()`, an interactive function to step through first-time setup.

<Code code={`
library(ghqc)
ghqc_setup()
`} lang="r" title="console" />

### Renviron
The user will be prompted to set the `GHQC_CONFIG_REPO` variable for the custom configuration repository. 
The inputted URL will be added to their `~/.Renviron`. 

<Tabs syncKey="new">
    <TabItem label = "First time setup">
        For initial setup, you will be prompted to enter the URL to your custom configuration repository.

        ```ansi ins="https://github.com/a2-ai/ghqc.example_config_repo"
        [36m--- [0mGHQC RENVIRON SETUP [36m-----------------------------------------------------

        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label = "Repeat setup">
        If you've setup ghqc before, you'll be prompted with the following in your console.

        If you'd like to change the URL, input `N`, then type in your desired URL. If not, input `y`.

        ```ansi "https://github.com/A2-ai/ghqc.example_info_repo"

    <a href="https://github.com/A2-ai/ghqc.example_config_repo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ghqc.example_config_repo</a> is an example repository and should be replaced by your organization's custom configuration repository URL.
  </p>
</Aside>

### Custom configuration repository

<Aside type = "caution">
`gert` is required to download the custom configuration repository. There will be a prompt if it is not installed:

```ansi
[38;5;226m![0m Package `gert` is not found in your project package library
  The custom configuration repository cannot be downloaded 
  unless this package is present
[35mWould you like to install `gert` to continue? (y/N) [2my 
```
</Aside>

Next, the user is prompted for the local directory in which to clone the repository.
The default location is according to the [XDG Base Directory specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/latest/), with a subfolder based on the repository name.

To install to the default directory, which is highly recommended, input `y`. If a different location is required, input the file path.

```ansi "ghqc.example_config_repo"
[36m--- [0mCUSTOM CONFIGURATION REPOSITORY [36m--------------------------------------

```

<Tabs syncKey="new">
    <TabItem label = "First time setup">
        <Card title = "Not Downloaded" icon="error">
        If you have not downloaded the repository before, the following prompt will appear. Input `y` to download.

        ```ansi "ghqc.example_config_repo"
        [38;5;160mx[0m Custom configuration repository ghqc.example_config_repo is not found locally

    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label = "Updates needed">
        <Card title = "Not Up To Date" icon="warning">
        If the repository has been downloaded previously, but it is not up to date with remote, the following prompt will appear.
        
        If there are local changes to the repo, pulling remote changes is not required. Input `y` to download the update.

        ```ansi "ghqc.example_info_repo"
        [38;5;160mx[0m Custom configuration repository ghqc.example_config_repo was found locally,

        </Card>
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label = "Repeat setup">
        <Card title = "Up to Date" icon = "approve-check-circle">
        If the repository is downloaded and up to date, you will be provided with the following:

        ```ansi "ghqc.example_info_repo"
        Custom Configuration Repository found up to date at 
        ~/.local/share/ghqc/ghqc.example_config_repo
        ```
        </Card>
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

After a successful download, the structure of the repository is verified for its compatiblility with the ghqc ecosystem.
This includes structural validation of each yaml checklist.

### ghqc.app dependency installation

To ensure `ghqc.app` dependencies do not interfere with project work, ghqc.app and its dependencies are installed in an isolated directory outside the QCed project.

The next prompt is to install or link the ghqc.app package dependencies.

```ansi
[36m--- [0mGHQC.APP DEPENDENCY INSTALLATION [36m----------------------------------------
[0mWould you like to INSTALL new packages form Posit Package Manager or LINK to a 
previously installed package library?

3. Neither

<Tabs syncKey="isoMethod">
    <TabItem label = "Install">
        If you are on a linux operating system, ghqc will install [the dependencies](../reference/ghqcapp-dependencies) from [PPM@2024-03-01](https://packagemanager.posit.co/cran/2024-03-01)

        <Aside type = "note">
        `pak` is highly recommended to improve package installation performance. While not required, it has no dependencies that may influence project work.

        There will be a prompt if `pak` is not installed:
        ```ansi
        [35mPackage `pak` is not found in your project package library. 
        To improve performance, would you like to install pak? (y/N) [2my
        ```
        </Aside>

        After inputting `1`, the user is prompted for the local directory in which to install ghqc.app dependencies. 
        To install to the default directory, which is highly recommended, input `y`.
        If a different location is required, input `N` to enter the file path.

        ```ansi
        [35mInstall ghqc.app dependencies to path:

        ```

        `ghqc` will check the content of the directory to ensure the correct packages and versions are installed.
        <Tabs syncKey="new">
            <TabItem label = "First time setup">
                If no packages are found, you will be prompted the following:

            <TabItem label = "Repeat setup">
                If all packages are installed, you will be provided with the following:

        If you have a package library previously installed, containing [all of the package versions required](../reference/ghqcapp-dependencies), [symlinking](https://servicenow.iu.edu/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0023928) will be the fastest option as it does not have to install anything.

        After entering `2`, you will be prompted to where to symlink the dependency packages from on your system.

        ```ansi
        [35mPath to previously installed package library from which to link:
        ```

        You will then be prompted with where to symlink the dependencies to. To set the destintation as the default directory, which is highly recommended, hit `ENTER`.
        If a different location is required, you are able to enter the file path.

        ```ansi
        [35mPath to link the ghqc.app dependencies (~/.local/share/ghqc/rpkgs)
        ```

        In order to prevent errors, the current content in the destintation is deleted and then the symlink occurs:
        ```ansi
        Linking ghqc.app dependency packages...
        Removing all packages in ~/.local/share/ghqc/rpkgs...

        ```
    </TabItem>
    <TabItem label = "Neither">
        To skip ghqc.app dependency installation in the interactive session, input `3`.

        A helper function [`ghqc::ghqc_libpath()`](https://a2-ai.github.io/ghqc/reference/ghqc_libpath.html) exists to create, if needed, and output the string to the default dependency directory.
    </TabItem>
</Tabs>

## Install ghqc.app

At the end of the ghqc.app dependency installation, the following note will print if ghqc.app is not installed in the 
```ansi
[38;5;226m![0m NOTE: ghqc.app is not installed in ~/.local/share/ghqc/rpkgs. 
  Please install before running any ghqc apps
```

Due to organizational requirements for package management and installation, the package orchestrating the Shiny apps is not installed as part of `ghqc::setup_ghqc()`. Either of the following commands will install the package:

```ansi
[2m# install.packages("pak")
[0mpak::pak([38;5;106m"a2-ai/ghqc.app"[0m, lib = [3;4mghqc::ghqc_libpath()[0m)
