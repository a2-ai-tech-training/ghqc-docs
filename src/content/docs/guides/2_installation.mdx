## Quick setup

To try out ghqc **without** your organization's custom configuration options, run the following 
commands to install the ecosystem and clone an <a href="https://github.com/A2-ai/ghqc.example_config_repo?tab=readme-ov-file#" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">example custom configuration repository<span style={{ display: 'inline-block', verticalAlign: 'middle' }}><Icon name="external" /></span></a>.

<Steps>

1. Set options to a CRAN-like repository with the ghqc ecosystem (this allows the setup function to install ghqc.app, an auxiliary helper package)
    ```r
    options("repos" = c(
        "ghqc-eco" = "https://prism.dev.a2-ai.cloud/rpkgs/ghqc-eco/v2", 
        getOption("repos")))
    ```
2. Install ghqc and its suggested dependencies
    ```r
    install.packages("ghqc", dependencies = TRUE)
    ```
3. Clone the example custom configuration repository and install ghqc.app dependencies and ghqc.app with:
    ```r
    ghqc::ghqc_example_setup()
    ```
</Steps>

Now you are set up to [run the apps](#run-the-apps).


## Organization setup

### Install ghqc

#### With rv

export const repositoriesCode = `{alias = "ghqc-eco", url = "https://prism.dev.a2-ai.cloud/rpkgs/ghqc-eco/v2"}`;

export const dependenciesCode = `{name = "ghqc", install_suggestions = true}`;

<Steps>
1. Add the PRISM ghqc ecosystem collection as the **first** repository listed in the <u>repositories</u> section of your rproject.toml.
    <Code code={repositoriesCode} lang="toml" title="rproject.toml" />
    
2. Add ghqc to the <u>dependencies</u> section of your rproject.toml.
    <Code code={dependenciesCode} lang="toml" title="rproject.toml" />
</Steps>

</Aside>


#### Without rv

<Steps>
1. Set options to a CRAN-like repository with the ghqc ecosystem
    ```r
    options("repos" = c(
        "ghqc-eco" = "https://prism.dev.a2-ai.cloud/rpkgs/ghqc-eco/v2", 
        getOption("repos")))
    ```
2. Install ghqc and its suggested dependencies
    ```r
    install.packages("ghqc", dependencies = TRUE)
    ```
</Steps>

### Install and setup the ecosystem

<Steps>
1. Run the interactive setup script.
    ```r
    library(ghqc)
    ghqc_setup()
    ```
2. Add the configuration repository to your `.Renviron`.

    A prompt will appear to set the `GHQC_CONFIG_REPO` variable for the custom configuration repository. 
    The inputted URL will be added to `~/.Renviron`. 

    <Tabs syncKey="new">
        <TabItem label = "First time setup">
            For initial setup, you will be prompted to enter the URL to your custom configuration repository.

            ```ansi ins="https://github.com/a2-ai/ghqc.example_config_repo"

        </TabItem>
        <TabItem label = "Repeat setup">
            If you've setup ghqc before, you'll be prompted with the following in your console.

            If you'd like to change the URL, input `N`, then type in your desired URL. If not, input `y`.

            ```ansi "https://github.com/A2-ai/ghqc.example_info_repo"

        <a href="https://github.com/A2-ai/ghqc.example_config_repo" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">ghqc.example_config_repo</a> is an example repository and should be replaced by your organization's custom configuration repository URL.
    </p>
    </Aside>

3. Clone the custom configuration repository

    <Aside type = "caution">
    `gert` is required to download the custom configuration repository. There will be a prompt if it is not installed:

    ```ansi
    [38;5;226m![0m Package `gert` is not found in your project package library
    The custom configuration repository cannot be downloaded 
    unless this package is present
    [35mWould you like to install `gert` to continue? (y/N) [2my 
    ```
    </Aside>

    Next, a prompt will appear for the local directory in which to clone the repository.
    The default location is according to the [XDG Base Directory specification](https://specifications.freedesktop.org/basedir-spec/latest/), with a subfolder based on the repository name.

    To install to the default directory, which is highly recommended, input `y`. If a different location is required, input the file path.

    ```ansi "ghqc.example_config_repo"
    [36m--- [0mCUSTOM CONFIGURATION REPOSITORY [36m--------------------------------------

        <TabItem label = "Repeat setup">
            <Card title = "Up to Date" icon = "approve-check-circle">
            If the repository is downloaded and up to date, you will be provided with the following:

            Custom Configuration Repository found up to date at 
            ~/.local/share/ghqc/ghqc.example_config_repo
            ```
            </Card>
        </TabItem>
    </Tabs>

    After a successful download, the structure of the repository is verified for its compatibility with the ghqc ecosystem.
    This includes structural validation of each yaml checklist.

4. ghqc.app dependency installation

    To ensure `ghqc.app` dependencies do not interfere with project work, ghqc.app and its dependencies are installed in an isolated directory outside the QCed project.

    A prompt will appear to install or link the ghqc.app package dependencies.

    ```ansi
    [36m--- [0mGHQC.APP DEPENDENCY INSTALLATION [36m----------------------------------------

            <Aside type = "note">
            `pak` is highly recommended to improve package installation performance. While not required, it has no dependencies that may influence project work.

            There will be a prompt if `pak` is not installed:
            ```ansi
            [35mPackage `pak` is not found in your project package library. 
            To improve performance, would you like to install pak? (y/N) [2my
            ```
            </Aside>

            After inputting `1`, the user is prompted for the local directory in which to install ghqc.app dependencies. 
            To install to the default directory, which is highly recommended, input `y`.
            If a different location is required, input `N` to enter the file path.

            ```ansi
            [35mInstall ghqc.app dependencies to path:

            If you have a package library previously installed, containing [all of the package versions required](../reference/ghqcapp-dependencies), [symlinking](https://servicenow.iu.edu/kb?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0023928) will be the fastest option as it does not have to install anything.

            After entering `2`, you will be prompted to where to symlink the dependency packages from on your system.

            ```ansi
            [35mPath to previously installed package library from which to link:
            ```

            You will then be prompted with where to symlink the dependencies to. To set the destination as the default directory, which is highly recommended, hit `ENTER`.
            If a different location is required, you are able to enter the file path.

            ```ansi
            [35mPath to link the ghqc.app dependencies (~/.local/share/ghqc/rpkgs)

        <TabItem label = "Neither">
            To skip ghqc.app dependency installation in the interactive session, input `3`.

            A helper function [`ghqc::ghqc_libpath()`](https://a2-ai.github.io/ghqc/reference/ghqc_libpath.html) exists to create, if needed, and output the string to the default dependency directory.

    </Tabs>

5. Install ghqc.app

    At the end of the ghqc.app dependency installation, the following note will print if ghqc.app is not installed in the ghqc directory.
    ```ansi
    [38;5;226m![0m NOTE: ghqc.app is not installed in ~/.local/share/ghqc/rpkgs. 
    Please install before running any ghqc apps
    ```

    If it is not an available package in the user's `options("repos")`, `ghqc.app` is not installed as part of `ghqc::ghqc_setup()`.\
    Manually install `ghqc.app` with the following command:

    ```ansi
    utils::install.packages([38;5;106m"ghqc.app"[0m, 
                            lib = [3;4mghqc::ghqc_libpath()[0m,

    ```


</Steps>


## Run the apps

To run the apps, ensure your project is open and is an initialized git repository with a remote upstream.

#### Via console

```r
library(ghqc)

# Assign QC file(s)
ghqc_assign_app()

# Status QC file(s)
ghqc_status_app()

# Generate QC Record
ghqc_record_app()
```
#### Via RStudio addins

Ensure `miniUI` is installed to use RStudio Addins.
