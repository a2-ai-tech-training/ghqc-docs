The Custom configuration repository hosts custom options for app inputs and outputs, including an organization's QC checklist templates. 


This git repo is 
- created and edited by organization administrators.
- cloned to an isolated non-project directory by users 

See an example configuration repository here: [ghqc.example_config_repo](https://github.com/A2-ai/ghqc.example_config_repo?tab=readme-ov-file#)<span style={{ display: 'inline-block', verticalAlign: 'middle' }}><Icon name="external" /></span>


The configuration repository can be named anything. The naming convention is ghqc.org, where org is the organization name.

The configuration repository https URL is inputted to ghqc via the GHQC_CONFIG_REPO environment variable.\
To set this variable, add it to your .Renviron:
```
GHQC_CONFIG_REPO=https://github.com/A2-ai/ghqc.example_info_repo.git
```


## Repo Structure

The the config repo must have a folder named "checklists" in the root.
The logo.png and options.yaml are optional.

If the logo.png or options.yaml are included, they must have those names exactly to be recognized by ghqc.

## Checklists

Checklists should be located in the checklists folder - ghqc accepts both `.txt` and specific `.yaml` formats.

### txt checklists

`.txt` checklists are the most flexible - any contents in .txt files are accepted by ghqc.

The template formats best as GitHub-flavored markdown, with headers beginning at header 2 (##).

The name of the checklist rendered in the app and Issue output is given by the file name: e.g. \`Code Review\`.txt 
(use back ticks to include spaces in the checklist template name).

The checklist title and prepended checklist note (if included) will prepend all generated checklists, so including a title in the template is not necessary.

```txt
# <Checklist title>

<prepended checklist note (if included)>

<checklist template in GFM>
```

The easiest way to create .txt checklist templates is to do so in a mock GitHub Issue, where its rendering can be previewed immediately 
before being pasting into a its corresponding .txt file.

### yaml checklists
yaml checklists have one of the following structures:

#### Simple structure

yaml contents:
```yaml
General Script:
  - good documentation
  - only relative paths to sourced files
  - consistent style and naming conventions
```
Output rendered in GitHub Issue:

<img width="324" alt="Screenshot 2025-01-23 at 3 25 33 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/246b1040-df10-491d-ad34-48fa420e1004" />

The simple structure:
- begins with the name of the checklist to be displayed in `ghqc_assign_app()` as the key
- the value is a list of checklist items, each of which is prepended with a tick mark on a new line

#### Header structure
yaml contents:
```yaml
Report:
  Table of Contents:
    - depth of 2

  Body:
    - Page numbers exist on each page
    - Page numbers indicate total page length (e.g. Page 1 of 3)

  Tables and Figures:
    - Titles are correct
    - Captions are descriptive
    - Footnotes are accurate

  Appendix:
    - |-
      Sources are given in one of the following formats:
        1) APA
        2) MLA
        3) Chicago
```
Output rendered in GitHub Issue:

<img width="432" alt="Screenshot 2025-01-23 at 3 26 29 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/4fd7c6a8-7489-4555-91cf-17ba532efee3" />

The header structure:
- begins with the name of the checklist to be displayed in `ghqc_assign_app()` as the key
- the value is a set of headers, which are keys themselves
- the value of each header key is a list of checklist items to appear under the header
- each checklist item is prepended with a tick mark on a new line

#### Extra considerations
- To include a colon in a checklist item, wrap it in quotation marks.\
  Example:
    ```yaml
    - "the code is: readable, scalable, and documented"
    ```
- To span a checklist item across multiple lines, begin the first line with the pipe operator, then start the checklist item contents on the next line.\
  Example:
  ```yaml
  - |-
      Sources are given in one of the following formats:
        1) APA
        2) MLA
        3) Chicago
  ```

## Logo

This file is optional.\
If included, it should be named logo.png to be recognized by the package.\
The function of this file is to supply an image appear in the header of each page of QC Records generated by `ghqc_record_app()`.\
For example, the logo of one's institution may be used.\
If not included, no image will appear in the headers of QC Records generated by `ghqc_record_app()`.

For example, here is the ghqc logo rendered in a QC Record:

<img width="873" alt="Screenshot 2025-01-23 at 4 52 27 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/e76ded2d-9449-4491-b99f-646fd8f60f2d" />


## Options

This file is optional.\
If included, it should be named options.yaml to be recognized by the package.\
The function of this file is to supply various user-options to ghqc operations.

### Recognized inputs
#### `prepended_checklist_note`

This option is optionally included.\
The function of this option is to prepend checklists rendered to GitHub with a note for users (either the author or QCer). For example, the note may prompt the script author to modify checklist items to make them more specific to the given script.\
If not included, no note will appear before generated checklists.


The key is `prepended_checklist_note`, and the value is the contents of the note.

Example:
```yaml
prepended_checklist_note: "Note: Please modify checklist items to insert relevant QC context."
```
Output rendered in GitHub Issue:

<img width="450" alt="Screenshot 2025-01-23 at 4 47 46 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/f8daa174-b1fd-4d07-bd43-203d95b6408f" />


#### `checklist_display_name_var`

This option is optionally included.\
The function of this option is to change the display name of the word "checklist" in `ghqc_assign_app()`.\
If not included, the word "checklist" will be displayed by default.

The key is `checklist_display_name_var`, and the value is the name to display in place of the word "checklist".

Example:
```yaml
checklist_display_name_var: "QC Assessment List"
```
Output rendered in `ghqc_assign_app()`:

<img width="589" alt="Screenshot 2025-01-23 at 4 58 58 PM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/dd769de0-e2f4-443e-8437-e7189d17a65f" />


## Repository and checklist validation in ghqc

ghqc will validate the structure of the repository and checklists when cloned via `ghqc_setup()`.

If the repository isn't formatted according to ghqc convention (the only requirement is the checklists directory):

<img width="690" alt="Screenshot 2025-01-24 at 9 39 08 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/58eeb815-e0ec-47ca-86f0-ff749d10e772" />

If this directory isn't present, an error will occur when running `ghqc_assign_app()`:

<img width="699" alt="Screenshot 2025-01-24 at 9 40 16 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b06c2b50-eea9-447b-b388-d19fec211daf" />



If checklists aren't formatted according to ghqc convention:

<img width="763" alt="Screenshot 2025-01-24 at 9 32 21 AM" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/40045027-f2ef-47f5-8847-485829785f21" />


## Validate structure
To check how ghqc parses the repository, run:
```r
ghqc::check_ghqc_configuration()
```
Alternatively, input the https URL when running `ghqc::ghqc_setup()`:

```r
> ghqc::ghqc_setup()
