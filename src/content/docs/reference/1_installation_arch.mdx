The ghqc ecosystem is split into 4 components to give the user control over the QC process
while ensuring additional project package dependencies are minimal.

<Card title="The QCed project" icon="github">
    Your GitHub repository, containing the files to be QCed.
</Card>
<Card title="ghqc" icon="add-document" color = "red">
    `ghqc` is a low dependency burden package designed to be installed alongside any project packages.
    It aids with the installation process and launches the Shiny applications as background jobs.
</Card>
<Card title="ghqc.app" icon="add-document">
    `ghqc.app` is a high dependency burden package "back-end" to the Shiny applications.
    To ensure `ghqc.app` dependencies do not interfere with project work, ghqc.app and its dependencies are installed in an isolated directory outside the QCed project.
</Card>
<Card title="Custom configuration repository " icon="information">
    Custom options for app inputs and outputs, including an organization's selectable QC checklists, are configured by an organization administrator in a custom configuration repository.

    `ghqc` users clone this repository locally to an isolated directory outside the QCed project.
