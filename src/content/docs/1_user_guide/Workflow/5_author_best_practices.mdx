## Put yourself in the QCer's shoes

export const assignAppCode = `library(ghqc)
ghqc_assign_app()`;
export const console = 'console';

<Code code={assignAppCode} lang="r" title={console} />

Preview the checklist in the app and cross off items as if you were the QCer.

<video controls width = "700">
    <source src="/ghqc-docs/qcers_shoes.mp4" type="video/mp4" />
</video>

Checking these items off in the app doesn't check them off in the actual rendered GitHub Issue.

## Edit each Issue's checklist template

Adapt checklist templates to fit the context of your QC. These templates are only a guide — your expertise is what makes them effective.

<Aside>
- Use cmd+f or ctrl+f to find placeholders in the template

- Avoid editing the _Issue title_, _Metadata_, or _Relevant files_ sections to ensure the app can parse information

## Notify file changes to the QCer with the Status app

export const statusAppCode = `library(ghqc)
ghqc_status_app()`;

<Code code={statusAppCode} lang="r" title={console} />

## Close Milestones when completed

When QC for each file in a Milestone is completed, each QC file's respective Issue should be closed via the “Approve” button in the Status app by their respective QCers. 

At this point, the Author can close the Milestone to indicate completed QC with no other QC files to add to the set.

Closing Milestones prevents them from loading by default in `ghqc_status_app()`
